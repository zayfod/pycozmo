PyCozmo
=======

`PyCozmo` is a pure-Python [Cozmo robot](https://www.digitaldreamlabs.com/pages/cozmo) communication library.
It allows controlling a Cozmo robot directly, without having to go through a mobile device, running the Cozmo app.

The library is loosely based on the [Anki Cozmo Python SDK](https://github.com/anki/cozmo-python-sdk) and the
[cozmoclad](https://pypi.org/project/cozmoclad/) ("C-Like Abstract Data") library.

This project is a tool for exploring the hardware and software of Digital Dream Labs (originally Anki) Cozmo robot.
It is unstable and heavily under development.


Usage
-----

Basic mode:
```python
import time
import pycozmo

def pycozmo_program(cli):
    cli.set_head_angle(angle=0.6)
    time.sleep(1)

pycozmo.run_program(pycozmo_program)
```

Advanced mode:
```python
import pycozmo

cli = pycozmo.Client()
cli.start()
cli.connect()
cli.wait_for_robot()

cli.drive_wheels(lwheel_speed=50.0, rwheel_speed=50.0, duration=2.0)

cli.disconnect()
cli.stop()
```

Connecting to Cozmo over Wi-Fi
------------------------------

A Wi-Fi connection needs to be established with Cozmo before using PyCozmo applications.

1. Wake up Cozmo by placing it on the charging platform
2. Make Cozmo display it's Wi-Fi PSK by rising and lowering its lift
3. Scan for Cozmo's Wi-Fi SSID (depends on the OS)
4. Connect using Cozmo's Wi-Fi PSK (depends on the OS)


PyCozmo vs. the Cozmo SDK
-------------------------

A Cozmo SDK application (aka "game") acts as a client to the Cozmo app (aka "engine") that runs on a mobile device.
The low-level communication happens over USB and is handled by the `cozmoclad` library.

In contrast, an application using PyCozmo basically replaces the Cozmo app and acts as the "engine". PyCozmo handles
the low-level UDP communication with Cozmo.
   
```
+------------------+                   +------------------+                   +------------------+
|     SDK app      |     Cozmo SDK     |    Cozmo app     |       Cozmo       |      Cozmo       |
|      "game"      |     cozmoclad     |     "engine"     |      protocol     |     "robot"      |
|                  | ----------------> |   Wi-Fi client   | ----------------> |     Wi-Fi AP     |
|                  |        USB        |    UDP client    |     UDP/Wi-Fi     |    UDP Server    |
+------------------+                   +------------------+                   +------------------+
```


Limitations
-----------

- some high-level Cozmo SDK features are implemented in the Cozmo app and have no equivalent in PyCozmo, today:
    - personality engine
    - behaviors
    - motion detection
    - face detection
    - facial expression estimation
    - text-to-speech
    - songs
- there is no Wi-Fi control. The library assumes a Wi-Fi connection to Cozmo, established in advance.


Requirements
------------
