Overview
========

[https://github.com/zayfod/pycozmo](https://github.com/zayfod/pycozmo)

`PyCozmo` is a pure-Python communication library, alternative SDK, and application for the
[Cozmo robot](https://www.digitaldreamlabs.com/pages/cozmo) . It allows controlling a Cozmo robot directly, without
having to go through a mobile device, running the Cozmo app.

The library is loosely based on the [Anki Cozmo Python SDK](https://github.com/anki/cozmo-python-sdk) and the
[cozmoclad](https://pypi.org/project/cozmoclad/) ("C-Like Abstract Data") library.

This project is a tool for exploring the hardware and software of the Digital Dream Labs (originally Anki) Cozmo robot.
It is unstable and heavily under development.


Usage
-----

Basic:

```python
import time
import pycozmo

with pycozmo.connect() as cli:
    cli.set_head_angle(angle=0.6)
    time.sleep(1)
```

Advanced:

```python
import pycozmo

cli = pycozmo.Client()
cli.start()
cli.connect()
cli.wait_for_robot()

cli.drive_wheels(lwheel_speed=50.0, rwheel_speed=50.0, duration=2.0)

cli.disconnect()
cli.stop()
```


PyCozmo vs. the Cozmo SDK
-------------------------

A Cozmo SDK application (aka "game") acts as a client to the Cozmo app (aka "engine") that runs on a mobile device.
The low-level communication happens over USB and is handled by the `cozmoclad` library.

In contrast, an application using PyCozmo basically replaces the Cozmo app and acts as the "engine". PyCozmo handles
the low-level UDP communication with Cozmo.
